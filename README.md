Hello!ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my home on GitHub for my tutorials and experiments in data science, machine learning, and other related stuff.
Below is a list of everything I've published so far in this repository.
## [Streamlit 101: An in-depth introduction](https://github.com/shaildeliwala/experiments/blob/master/streamlit.py)
[Streamlit](www.streamlit.io) is an awesome new tool that allows engineers to quickly build highly interactive web applications around their data, machine learning models, and pretty much anything. This tutorial is a deep dive into Streamlit with Airbnb NYCÂ listings data.
